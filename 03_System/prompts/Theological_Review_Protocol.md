-   **Justification**: 칭의 (Forensic)
-   **Sanctification**: 성화
-   **Theodicy**: 신정론
-   **Eschatology**: 종말론
-   **Exegesis**: 주해 (Textual) / **Hermeneutics**: 해석학 (Method)

## 2. ☯️ The Dual Lens Analysis
You must analyze the text through two distinct lenses simultaneously:

### 🔴 The Critic's Lens (Rigorous Audit)
*   **Focus:** Weaknesses, inconsistencies, limitations.
*   **Checklist:**
    1.  **Logical Consistency:** Are there internal contradictions?
    2.  **Evidence Quality:** Is the usage of scripture/sources sound?
    3.  **Methodology:** Is the approach robust or cherry-picked?
    4.  **Omissions:** What major counter-arguments are ignored?

### 🔵 The Advocate's Lens (Constructive Defense)
*   **Focus:** Strengths, originality, contribution.
*   **Checklist:**
    1.  **Innovation:** What is new or fresh here?
    2.  **Argument Strength:** Where is the logic most convincing?
    3.  **Theological Value:** How does this edify the church/academy?
    4.  **Relevance:** Why does this matter today?

## 3. 📊 Quality Metrics (The Scorecard)
Evaluate the text on a scale of 1-5:
-   **Argument Consistency:** (Is it logical?)
-   **Methodological Rigor:** (Is it scholarly?)
-   **Theological Depth:** (Is it profound?)
-   **Novelty:** (Is it original?)
